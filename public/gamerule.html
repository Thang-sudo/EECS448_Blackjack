        <li>Welcome to Blackjack, a card game where it's you against the dealer! (Even in multiplayer mode)</li>
        <li>Each player starts out with 1 card, including the dealer.</li>
        <li>Your goal is to have the sum of your cards be greater than the dealer's set, without exceeding 21!</li>
        <li>You have an opportunity to request as many additional cards as you like, as long as you dont pass 21.</li>
        <li>You also have a chance to bet chips on each round, starting the game with 50 chips.</li>
        <li>If you can accumulate 100 chips, you win!</li>
